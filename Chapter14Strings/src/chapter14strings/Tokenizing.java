/*
 * (Tokenizing Telephone Numbers) Write an application that inputs a telephone number as a
string in the form (555) 555-5555 . The application should use String method split to extract the
area code as a token, the first three digits of the phone number as a token and the last four digits of
the phone number as a token. The seven digits of the phone number should be concatenated into
one string. Both the area code and the phone number should be printed. Remember that youâ€™ll have
to change delimiter characters during the tokenization process.
