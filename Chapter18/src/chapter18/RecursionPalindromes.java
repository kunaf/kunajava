/*
(Palindromes) A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same way forward and backward.
Some examples of palindromes are “radar,” “able was i ere i saw elba” and (if spaces are ignored) “a
man a plan a canal panama.” Write a recursive method testPalindrome that returns boolean value
true if the string stored in the array is a palindrome and false otherwise. The method should ignore
spaces and punctuation in the string.
