/*
 *( Quadrilateral Inheritance Hierarchy) Write an inheritance hierarchy for classes Quadrilateral, parallelogram, rectangle
and Square . Use Quadrilateral as the superclass
of the hierarchy. Create and use a Point class to represent the points in each shape. Make the hier-
archy as deep (i.e., as many levels) as possible. Specify the instance variables and methods for each
class. The private instance variables of Quadrilateral should be the x-y coordinate pairs for the
four endpoints of the Quadrilateral . Write a program that instantiates objects of your classes and
outputs each objectâ€™s area (except Quadrilateral ).
