/*
(Prime Numbers and Prime Factors) Write a program that takes a whole number input
from a user and determines whether it’s prime. If the number is not prime, display its unique prime
factors. Remember that a prime number’s factors are only 1 and the prime number itself. Every
number that’s not prime has a unique prime factorization. For example, consider the number 54.
The prime factors of 54 are 2, 3, 3 and 3. When the values are multiplied together, the result is 54.
For the number 54, the prime factors output should be 2 and 3. Use Set s as part of your solution
